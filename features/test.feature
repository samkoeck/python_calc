Feature: I want to be able to add numbers in the string calculator code kata

  Scenario: the one with an empty string
    Given an empty string
    When the string is calculated
    Then the result is 0

  Scenario: the one with two comma separated numbers in a string
    Given a string "1,2"
    When the string is calculated
    Then the result is 3

  Scenario: the one with three comma separated numbers in a string
    Given a string "1,2,5"
    When the string is calculated
    Then the result is 8

#   Scenario: The one with an illegal number
#     Given a string "1,2,-3"
#     Then the calculation of the string throws a NegativeNumberNotAllowed exception

#  Scenario Outline: the ones to verify that number over 1000 are not included in the sum
#     Given a string "<numbers>"
#     When the string is calculated
#     Then the result is <result>

#     Examples:
#       |numbers | result |
#       |1,999   | 1000   |
#       |1,1000  | 1001   |
#       |1,1001  | 1      |

#   Scenario: the one with a different separator
#     Given a string "|1|2|3"
#     When the string is calculated
#     Then the result is 6


#   Scenario Outline: the one with many numbers
#     Given a string "<numbers>"
#     When the string is calculated
#     Then the result is <result>

#     Examples:
#     |numbers | result |
#     |   1,5  |   6    |
#     | 1,5,6  |  12    |
#     | 7,7,7  |  21    |
#     | 7,8,7  |  22    |
#     | 7,9,7  |  23    |
#     | 7,10,7 |  24    |
#     | 7,11,7 |  25    |
#     | 7,12,7 |  26    |
#     | 7,13,7 |  27    |
